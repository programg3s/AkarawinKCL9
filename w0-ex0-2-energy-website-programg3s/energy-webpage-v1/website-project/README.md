# Website Project

This project is a simple website that provides information about appliance energy consumption in the Australian market. It consists of three main pages: Home, Televisions, and About Us. The website features a top navigation menu for easy navigation, a footer with acknowledgments, and is styled with CSS to match the colors of the logo.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Home page of the website with navigation, footer, and placeholder content.
- `televisions.html`: Page dedicated to televisions, including relevant energy consumption information.
- `about-us.html`: Information about the website or organization, maintaining the same navigation and footer.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains all the styles for the website, including navigation menu styles, footer styles, and hover effects.
- `js/script.js`: JavaScript code that enables navigation functionality and provides user feedback on the current page.

## Setup Instructions
